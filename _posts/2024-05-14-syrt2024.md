Each year at the INT (Institut de Neurosciences de la TImone) the students organize the so called <b>INT student meeting</b>. 
It is an opportunity for the PhD students to present their projects and to get feedback from the whole intitute.

This year I decided to present a poster of my current project, supervised by Matthieu Gilson and Andrea Brovelli.
