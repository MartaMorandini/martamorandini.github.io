SegXy Team
</h2>

For the <a href="https://complexity72h.com/" style="color:#c9a0dc;">fifth edition</a> of the  <a href="https://twitter.com/Complexity72h/status/1806779566968766824
" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Complexity72h Workshop</a>, I joined the project proposed by <a href="https://mattiamazzoli.github.io/" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Mattia Mazzoli</a> about mobility patterns and segregation in Spain. 
We manage to produce a full paper in just 72 hours and I think it turned out pretty great.
It's still a work in progress, but Mattia was pretty amazing at supervising six people all at once.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
</div>
<div class="container is-centered">
Segregation encodes information about society, such as social cohesion, mixing, and inequality.
However, most past and current studies tackled socioeconomic (SE) segregation by analyzing static
aggregated mobility networks, often without considering further individual features beyond income
and, most importantly, without distinguishing individual-level from location-based income. Accessing
individual-level income may help mapping macroscopic behavior into more granular mobility patterns,
hence impacting segregation estimates. Here we combine a mobile phone dataset of daily mobility
flows across Spanish districts stratified and adjusted by age, gender and income with census data of
districts median income. We build mobility-based SE assortativity matrices for multiple demographics
and observe mobility patterns of three income groups with respect to location-based SE classes.
We find that SE assortativity differs when isolating the mobility of specific income groups: we
observe that groups prefer to visit areas with higher average income than their own, which we call
preferential mobility. Our analysis suggests substantial differences between weekdays and weekends
SE assortativity by age class, with weekends characterized by higher SE assortativity. Our modeling
approach shows that the radiation model, which typically performs best at reproducing inter-municipal
population mobility, best fits middle income and middle-aged flows, while performing worse on
young and low income groups. Our double-sided approach, focusing on assortativity patterns and
mobility modeling, suggests that state of the art mobility models fail at capturing preferential mobility
behavior. Overall, our work indicates that mobility models considering the interplay of SE preferential
behavior, age and gender gaps may sensibly improve the state of the art models performance.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Tresure Hunt in Chinchón - The Snake Team</h2>
The ice breaker tresure hunt was the perfect way to start the week. 
We got lost in Chinchón, a beautiful and old village in the middle of Spain. 
Even if we didn't win it felt like a victory. 
The food, the wine and the place were amazing, but the organization of the event had something more special.
