<h1>10-day course in theoretical and computational neuroscience</h1>

From cellular to whole-brain levels, the course was structured in thematic days with lectures, tutorials, and project work.

I joined the whole-brain project by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Breyton" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Martin Breyton</a>. The goal of the project was the exploration of the parameters space of the new dopamine model, to assess the possible dynamics of model.

Organized by <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damien-Depannemaecker" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Damien Depannemaecker</a>, <a href = "https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=x-MyT34AAAAJ&hl=en" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Alain Destexhe</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ZVdLpMAAAAJ&hl=en" style="color:#c9a0dc;">Viktor Jirsa</a>.
