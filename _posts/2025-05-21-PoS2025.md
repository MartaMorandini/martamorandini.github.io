The Pint of Science festival aims to deliver interesting and relevant talks on the latest science research in an accessible format to the public â€“ mainly across bars, pubs, cafes and other public spaces. We want to provide a platform which allows people to discuss research with the people who carry it out and no prior knowledge of the subject is required. We are a network of thousands of volunteers who are passionate about bringing discoveries to people and was established by a community of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in 2013.
